description: A Data Scientist and Data Analyst focused on transforming raw data into structured insight that drives informed decision-making. I work at the intersection of analytics, business intelligence, and machine learning, building systems that are practical, scalable, and results-oriented. 
My core toolkit includes Python, SQL, Excel, and Power BI, which I use to extract, analyze, model, and visualize data across structured and unstructured sources. I prioritize clarity, accuracy, and actionable insight over complexity. 
I approach data with a balance of analytical depth and business awareness, ensuring that technical solutions translate into real-world impact.
